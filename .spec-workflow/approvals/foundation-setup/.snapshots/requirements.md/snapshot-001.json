  "content": "# Requirements Document: Foundation Setup\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Foundation Setup establishes the core technical infrastructure for the Decari MVP, a content and funnel website that helps parents, schools, and institutions find qualified school support services (Schulbegleitung). This foundation provides the essential project structure, build tools, database setup, validation schemas, UI component library, and basic configuration needed for all subsequent features.\n\n**Purpose:** Create a production-ready Next.js application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Prisma ORM, Zod validation, and shadcn/ui components that follows the architecture defined in the steering documents.\n\n**Value:** Enables rapid feature development by providing a consistent, type-safe, and well-structured codebase that all team members and AI agents can build upon with confidence.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nFrom `product.md`:\n- **Primary Objective:** Enable rapid MVP launch with ≥100 qualified leads/month and ≥3% landing-to-lead conversion\n- **Product Principle \"Handlungsfähigkeit in <5 Minuten\":** Fast, reliable technical foundation ensures quick page loads and smooth user experience\n- **Product Principle \"Datenbasierte Iteration\":** Proper analytics setup (PostHog) from day one enables data-driven optimization\n\nFrom `tech.md`:\n- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15+ (App Router), React 19+, TypeScript 5.3+, Tailwind CSS 4.0+, Prisma 5.7+, pnpm 8+\n- **Design System:** shadcn/ui (exclusively), Tailwind custom theme, no other UI libraries\n- **Database:** Vercel Postgres (Neon), Prisma ORM, minimal MVP schema (Lead, Appointment models)\n- **Quality Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, Ultracite (AI code review), Vitest, Playwright\n\nFrom `structure.md`:\n- **Architecture:** Standard Next.js App Router structure (no monorepo)\n- **Organization:** `app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/types/`, `prisma/`\n- **Naming:** kebab-case files, PascalCase components, camelCase functions\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Project Initialization\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly initialized Next.js 15 project with pnpm and TypeScript, so that I can start building features immediately with modern tooling.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.
